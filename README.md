## Introduction
This work is a image classification project done in a group of two, needed to pass the course of Machine Learning in a Data Science Master degree. 

Since is a basic course of Machine Learning, the techniques used are not advanced. Thus, the results can not be optimal. We are aware that we could have possibly obtained a better result using different algorithms, as many have done - you can that see also in the git hub repository of the dataset.

We can also have done some mistakes - for example we could have used a random seed as an hyperparameter in the neural network implementation - but we'll do better in next projects, learning from each other.

## The files
You will find a .pdf document, representing our report to the project and directed to the professor; and an .ipynb file, containing our project.

## Conclusion
This is my very first approach to a machine learning task without the supervision of someone actually knowing very well the subject. If you are here, probably you know me or you are evaluating me for some job. I hope I got better since this work. Obviously, don't hesitate to contact me for any kind of question related to the project, and, if you want, also to give me some suggestion and help. 

Enjoy
